## [EDIT THIS DOCUMENT](http://bit.ly/EditImpactBibliography)

### What's in here?

This bibliography contains a smattering of pieces, long and short, that are relevant to the study of media impact. From blog posts and case studies to fully-developed frameworks for analysis, reading selections from this list should quickly get you up to speed with the field.

</br>
### Where do I start?

There are so many good pieces in here, but these are three of my favorites:

- Tofel, Richard J., "Non-profit journalism -- Issues around impact: A white paper from ProPublica," February, 2013. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/about/LFA_ProPublica-white-paper_2.1.pdf](http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/about/LFA_ProPublica-white-paper_2.1.pdf)

- Stray, Jonathan, “Metrics, metrics everywhere: How do we measure the impact of journalism?," Nieman Journalism Lab, August 17, 2012.
[http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/metrics-metrics-everywhere-how-do-we-measure-the-impact-of-journalism/](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/metrics-metrics-everywhere-how-do-we-measure-the-impact-of-journalism/)

- Linch, Greg, "Quantifying impact: A better metric for measuring journalism", January 14, 2012.
[http://www.greglinch.com/blog/2012/01/14/quantifying-impact-a-better-metric-for-measuring-journalism/](http://www.greglinch.com/blog/2012/01/14/quantifying-impact-a-better-metric-for-measuring-journalism/)

</br>
### Can I add something?

Sure! Just go [here](http://bit.ly/EditImpactBibliography) and edit the document using [Draft](https://draftin.com/) -- a great new tool for versioned writing.  Once you add something, I'll update this website to reflect those changes.

</br>
### This format is ugly!

I know, I'm horrible at design.  Feel free to take all these links and make something pretty and more useful!
